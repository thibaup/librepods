"""
Reading an Apple account directly, instead of importing a zip somebody made on a Mac.

The desktop exporter is a UI over :mod:`exporter.icloud`, and that module is pure Python with no
desktop in it - so the app can run the same pipeline. This is the layer between it and Java:
one flow, four steps, each a separate call because a person has to answer something between
them.

    open -> recoveryOptions -> unlock(serial, passcode) -> fetch

**Why a session object rather than four functions.** Two of the steps need what the previous one
opened - a keychain session and a Find My client, both of which hold sockets - and the passcode
step waits on a dialog. Java holds the session for as long as that takes and closes it when the
screen goes away.

**Everything here returns a JSON string, including failures.** A raised Python exception arrives
in Java as a `PyException` whose message is whatever `str()` produced, which for several of the
errors worth reporting here is the empty string. The app has already shipped one dialog reading
`Login failed:` with nothing after it. So a failure is a value: `{"ok": false, "reason": ...,
"message": ...}`, and the `reason` is what Java branches on so the wording stays in
`strings.xml` where it can be translated.

**Nothing here writes to the account.** Recovery unwraps shares to a key; it does not enrol this
device as a peer, sign anything, or create a record. That is a deliberate line, and the moment
something crosses it this docstring should stop saying so.
