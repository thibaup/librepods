FindMy.py defaults to five seconds total per request, which suits a desktop on a good connection

be an Anisette server in the middle generating its data on demand.

**Thirty, to match the other half of the same sign-in.** `AdiProvisioning` already uses thirty
second connect and read timeouts for the exchange it makes with Apple directly, and it is the
same network at the same moment - so the two halves having different patience only meant that
whichever ran second was the one that failed.

Measured rather than guessed: a login on an emulator with roughly 500ms round trips to Apple, and
a site-local IPv6 address that routes nowhere, spent its whole five second budget inside
happy-eyeballs and arrived as a bare `TimeoutError`. Provisioning survived the identical network.

    Fetch the reports an accessory produced inside a specific time window.

    `fetch_location_history(accessory)` cannot do this. For a rolling-key accessory it calls
    `_fetch_accessory_reports(..., only_latest=True)`, which walks backwards from *now* and
    returns as soon as the first batch of keys yields anything - roughly the last day, since
    an AirTag steps its index every 15 minutes and Apple takes ~290 keys per request. It also
    takes no date range at all: 0.9.x removed the range parameters that 0.7.6 had.

    So asking for last Tuesday returned today's reports, which the caller then filtered away
    to nothing. The history screen showed data for today and empty days behind it, for every
    tag, with no error anywhere.

    What the library does expose is the two halves needed to do it properly:

      * `accessory.keys_between(start, end)` yields `(index, key)` for exactly the window,
        both primary and secondary, already de-duplicated
      * `fetch_location_history(list_of_keys)` batches plain keys into a single request and
        decrypts what comes back

    So we generate the window's keys ourselves, ask for those, and update the accessory's
    alignment from each report - `keys_between` tells us which index a key belongs to, which
    is the piece `_fetch_key_reports` cannot know and therefore does not do.

    Ordering note: alignment is established *before* generating keys, not after. An accessory
    with no alignment spans a huge index range, so `keys_between` would yield tens of
    thousands of keys for a single day. One bounded recent probe collapses that first. This is
    the same bounded path used by `_fetchReportsForAccessory`, rather than an unbounded
    `fetch_location` walk that can spend minutes deriving historical keys on Android.
