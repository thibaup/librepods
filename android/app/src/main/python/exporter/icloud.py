"""
Reading accessories out of an iCloud account, ready to export.

The half of the exporter that talks to Apple. Everything user-facing is a callback, so the CLI
and the windowed wizard drive the same flow with their own prompts rather than each implementing
it - and nothing here prints or reads from a terminal.

**Read-only.** Signing in, recovering keys and fetching records leave nothing behind on the
account: no escrow record is created and no peer joins the trust circle. FindMy.py has a second
passcode flow that *does* write - it enrols a new recovery record - and this never calls it.
Exporting is a read.

**Nothing is persisted.** FindMy.py's own examples save the account to `account.json`, password
included, and that is not copied here. The Apple ID password and the device passcode are used
inside one call each and dropped. A run starts from nothing, every time.
