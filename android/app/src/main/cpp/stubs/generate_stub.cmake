#
# Each function logs its own name and returns zero. That matters more than it looks: it is how
# we find out whether ADI ever actually calls into CoreFoundation or mediaplatform. A stub that
# aborted would tell us only that something went wrong; one that logs and returns tells us
# precisely which symbols are reached, and lets the run continue to see what else is.
#
# Returning long rather than void is deliberate. The real signatures vary and we do not know
# them, but on both ABIs an integer return lands in the same register a pointer would, so
# callers expecting a pointer see NULL and callers expecting an int see 0 - the two harmless
# answers. Functions that return structs by value would not be handled correctly; if any turn
# out to be called, they need writing by hand.

# Run with cmake -P, which does not inherit the project's policies. Without this, IN_LIST is
# treated as a plain argument rather than an operator (CMP0057) and the expected-symbol lookup
# fails to parse.
