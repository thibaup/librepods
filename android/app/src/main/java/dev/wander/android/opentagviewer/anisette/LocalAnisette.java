/**
 * Anisette, produced on this device instead of by somebody else's server.
 *
 * <p>This is the single entry point for the whole mechanism: it downloads Apple's ADI
 * libraries on first use, verifies them, provisions once, and then hands out the two values a
 * login needs. Everything it does is lazy - nothing happens until a login actually asks - and
 * everything it does can fail without breaking the app, because the remote Anisette server
 * remains as a fallback.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is worth having.</b> Today every login is relayed through a public Anisette
 * server: an operator sees the traffic, and logins stop working when their machine does. None
 * of that is necessary - Apple's libraries are native Android code and run perfectly well in
 * this process.
 *
 * <p><b>Threading.</b> Everything here blocks: it downloads, hashes and talks to Apple. Call
 * it from a background thread. It is safe to call {@link #ensureReady} repeatedly; the
 * expensive parts happen once.
